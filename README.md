# Rhythmic Ranker: Gymnastics Scoring Solution

## Overview

Rythmic Ranker is a cutting-edge solution designed to revolutionize the scoring process in rhythmic gymnastics competitions. Leveraging advanced technology, our solution aims to enhance accuracy, fairness, and efficiency in evaluating gymnastic performances. By integrating real-time data acquisition, artificial intelligence analysis, and intuitive presentation modules, Rhythmic Ranker provides judges with comprehensive insights, facilitating informed scoring decisions.

## Goal

The primary goal of Rhythmic Ranker is to address the inherent challenges and limitations associated with traditional scoring methods in rhythmic gymnastics. These challenges often stem from subjective interpretations, human error, and inefficiencies in data processing. Rhythmic Ranker seeks to overcome these obstacles by introducing a data-driven approach that ensures objective assessment based on measurable criteria.

## Solution Components

Rhythmic Ranker comprises three core components:

1. **Data Acquisition Interface:** Responsible for receiving continuous data streams from gymnastic performance capture systems via an API. These metrics are then stored in a dedicated NoSQL database to facilitate seamless data management and scalability.

2. **Intelligent Analysis Module:** Utilizes advanced algorithms to analyze data stored in the NoSQL database. This module determines the executed figure, conducts conformity checks against predefined scoring criteria, and ensures accurate and objective evaluation.

3. **Presentation Module:** Presents the estimated figure and conformity assessment derived from the intelligent analysis module in a user-friendly interface. This interface provides judges with clear, comprehensive, and real-time insights into gymnastic performances, streamlining the scoring process.

## Key Features

- Real-time data acquisition and analysis.
- Objective evaluation based on predefined scoring criteria.
- User-friendly interface for judges, facilitating informed scoring decisions.
- Scalable architecture, adaptable to varying competition requirements.
- Enhanced accuracy and fairness in scoring gymnastic performances.

## Legal Considerations

Rhythmic Ranker recognizes the importance of data security and legal compliance. To address these concerns, the solution incorporates robust security measures to safeguard data integrity and confidentiality during competitions. Additionally, clear guidelines are established for the external usage and exploitation of the solution to ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
