### Reuse of "Information" under this license

The "Licensor" grants the "Reuser" a non-exclusive and free right of free "Reuse" of the "Information" subject to this license, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, worldwide and for an unlimited duration, under the conditions expressed below.

**The "Reuser" is free to reuse the "Information":**

- to communicate, reproduce, copy it;
- to adapt, modify, extract, and transform it, notably to create "Derived Information";
- to distribute, redistribute, publish, and transmit it, to exploit it commercially, for example by combining it with other information, or by including it in your own product or application.

**Subject to:**

- mentioning the paternity of the "Information": its source (at least the name of the "Licensor") and the date of the last update of the reused "Information".

The "Reuser" can in particular fulfill this condition by indicating the address (URL) referring to the "Information" and ensuring an effective mention of its paternity.

**For example:**

In the case of reuse of the SIRENE database from INSEE, mention the URL of the "Licensor": www.insee.fr + the date of the last update of the reused Information.

This mention of paternity must neither confer an official character on the "Reuse" of the "Information", nor suggest any recognition or endorsement by the "Licensor", or by any other public entity, of the "Reuser" or its "Reuse".

### Personal data

The "Information" made available may contain "Personal Data" that may be subject to "Reuse". Then, the "Licensor" informs the "Reuser" (by any means) of their presence, the "Information" may be freely reused, without obstructing the freedoms granted by this license, provided that the legal framework relating to the protection of personal data is respected.

### Intellectual property rights

The "Reuser" is guaranteed that the "Information" does not contain any "Intellectual Property Rights" belonging to third parties that could obstruct the freedoms granted to it by this license.

Any "Intellectual Property Rights" held by the "Licensor" on the "Information" do not obstruct the freedoms granted by this license. When the "Licensor" holds "Intellectual Property Rights" on the "Information", it assigns them to the "Reuser" on a non-exclusive basis, free of charge, worldwide, for the entire duration of the "Intellectual Property Rights", and the "Reuser" can use them in any way in accordance with the freedoms and conditions defined by this license.

### Liability

The "Information" is made available as produced or received, without any other express or implied warranty not provided by this license. The absence of defects or errors possibly contained in the "Information", as well as the continuous provision of the "Information", are not guaranteed by the "Licensor". It cannot be held responsible for any loss, damage, or other liability of any kind caused to third parties by the "Reuse".

The "Reuser" is solely responsible for the "Reuse" of the "Information".

The "Reuse" must not mislead third parties as to the content of the "Information", its source, and its date of update.

### Applicable law

This license is governed by French law.

#### Compatibility of this license

It has been designed to be compatible with any free license that requires _at least_ the mention of paternity. It is notably compatible with the previous version of this license as well as with the "Open Government License" (OGL) of the United Kingdom, the "Creative Commons Attribution" (CC-BY) of Creative Commons, and the "Open Data Commons Attribution" (ODC-BY) of the Open Knowledge Foundation.

### About this license

This license is intended to be used by administrations for the reuse of their public information. It can also be used by anyone wishing to make "Information" available under the conditions defined by this license.

France has a comprehensive legal framework aimed at the spontaneous dissemination by administrations of their public information in order to enable its widest possible reuse.

The right to "Reuse" information from administrations is governed by the code of relations between the public and the administration (CRPA) and, where applicable, the heritage code (book II relating to archives).

This license facilitates the free and unrestricted reuse of public information and is among the licenses that can be used by the administration under the decree issued.
